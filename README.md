# Rumor spreading in a social network
Observe the building of a spatial network and the propagation of a rumor. 

1 - Create an artificial social network with the Barabasi model (inspired by the code of Sarah Schottler https://observablehq.com/@sarah37/barabasi-albert-simulation). 

2 - When you've reached the size you like, plant a rumor in a certain percentage of the population. 

3 - Observe the spreading of the rumor under the following rule: when two of your neighbours are convinced by the rumor, you get convinved yourself.
